# CS260 PROJECT: Probabilistic and Deep Machine Learning Techniques for Object Detection
This repository contains the code for a project for CS260 at UCLA. 
For this project, we developed object segmentation and bounding box detecting using a probablistic approach, and compared said approach to a deep learning approach (YOLOv3).
This repository contans the code for the probablistic, Gaussian model approach. 
Comparison against YOLOv3 approach can be seen in our report.
